		<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
		<p>Working with partner, write functions that take user input.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>We tried to solve the bonus questios and we were confused at first. The bonus task was quite difficult and we spent a lot of time on that.  </p>
		<h2>Result</h2>
		<p>Below is my program execution. I don't know if I did bonus task 3 correctly because I only capilatize the first letter of my shuffle name. And I have my previous shuffle function code in the js.file.</p>
		<h2>Script Output</h2>
		<div class= "output">
			 <script src="js/lab.js"></script>
    </div>
