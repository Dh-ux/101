  	<h1>Lab 14: Debugging</h1>
  		<h2>Challenges</h2>
    		<p>Actually, no bug in the previous questions. The largest Challenge is that we try hard to find something to debug and try to be familiar with the process. But we feel that it is irrational so we set a pipeline of debugging to try to get in the way of the debugging process. </p>

  		<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>No problems for this lab.</p>

  		<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Set several breakpoints.</p>
